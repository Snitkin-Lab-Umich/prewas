Description: This package is a tool to standardize the pre-processing of your
    genomic data before performing a bacterial genome-wide association study
    (bGWAS). prewas creates a variant matrix (where each row is a variant, each
    column is a sample, and the entries are presence - 1 - or absence - 0 - of
    the variant) that can be used as input for bGWAS tools. When creating the
    binary variant matrix, prewas can perform 3 pre-processing steps including:
    dealing with  multiallelic SNPs, (optional) dealing with SNPs in
    overlapping genes, and choosing a reference allele. prewas can output
    matrices for use with both SNP-based bGWAS and gene-based bGWAS.
