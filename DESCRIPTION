Description: Standardize the pre-processing of genomic variants before 
    performing a bacterial genome-wide association study (bGWAS). prewas creates
    a variant matrix (where each row is a variant, each column is a sample, and 
    the entries are presence - 1 - or absence - 0 - of the variant) that can be 
    used as input for bGWAS tools. When creating the binary variant matrix, 
    prewas can perform 3 pre-processing steps including: dealing with 
    multiallelic SNPs, (optional) dealing with SNPs in overlapping genes, and 
    choosing a reference allele. prewas can output matrices for use with both 
    SNP-based bGWAS and gene-based bGWAS. This method is described in Saund et 
    al. (2020) <https://doi.org/10.1099/mgen.0.000368>. prewas can also provide 
    gene matrices for variants with specific SnpEff annotations (Cingolani et 
    al. 2012).
