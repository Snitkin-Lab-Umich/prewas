## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.2 & devel
* win, R 3.5.3, 3.6.2 & devel

## Check results for OS X:

## Check results for win:

NOTE: 
```
Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Pre (3:13)
  bGWAS (12:6, 14:48, 18:42, 18:63)
  multiallelic (16:19)
  pre (10:56, 15:49)
  prewas (12:14, 15:28, 17:57)
```

The NOTE is spurious because these words are all correctly spelled technical 
terms.
