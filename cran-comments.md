## Package update
In this package version I have:

* Given change in as.factor=FALSE default behavior in R 4.0 code was changed to keep data correctly typed. 
* Added three new user-facing features. 
* Added more data.
* Updated documentation.

I tested the package on: 
* local OS X install, R 3.6.2
* win, R 3.6.3

## Check results for OS X:
No errors, warnings, or notes.

## Check results for win:
0 ERROR | 0 WARNING | 1 NOTE

NOTE: 
```
Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Cingolani (29:61)
  SnpEff (29:41)
```

The NOTE is spurious because these words are all correctly spelled technical terms and names.
