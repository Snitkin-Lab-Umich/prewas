## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed "This package" from the beginning of the description field.

* Added a reference to the methods paper in the description field in the form of
  Author (year) <doi:...>

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.2 & devel
* win, R 3.5.3, 3.6.2 & devel

## Check results for OS X:
No errors, warnings, or notes.

## Check results for win:
0 ERROR | 0 WARNING | 1 NOTE

NOTE: 
```
Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Pre (3:13)
  Saund (27:71)
  al (28:5)
  bGWAS (20:59, 23:23, 27:15, 27:36)
  et (27:77)
  multiallelic (25:5)
  pre (19:30, 24:26)
  prewas (20:67, 24:5, 26:34)
```

The NOTE is spurious because these words are all correctly spelled technical 
terms, names, or Latin.
